/** Topics
    Until now we worked in a single html file whiched contains
    all stuff in one html, template, vue instance and styles.
    This setup works for very small and simple applications.
    It's not a setup that you will use for medium and large
    applicaitons.

    We will move the things that we've learned into a different
    set up. We will dive into making bigger applications with
    lots of pieces and we need different tools about that stuff.

    So before we dive in let's find out what features and 
    improvements will have that kind of worflow. 
    
    1. Babel (use ES6 code)
    We need a way to write ES6 code(the next version of js) 
    and we a tool that compiles ES6 to ES5 so we can use all
    the cool new features of ES6 and still have code which 
    runs in the browser. 

    2. Development server 
    We also need a development server. Why we need one?
    Eventualy we will serve our application to a real server
    and therefore we want to test our application on such 
    circumstances. The file protocol (file://) which we use
    when we double click on html file does not have the same
    specifications and features the http protocol has.
    So we want to access vuejs through http and for that
    we need a server. Even it will run on our machine we need
    a server which will understand http to test our app on
    more realistic circumstances. We also can have a project 
    that doesn't load all the files on start up. For example
    lazy loading some elements. Or routing some components
    dynamically and changing the url. 

    3. Development Workflow
    What is Development Workflow? Until now our workflow
    was paste in script imported at the top. This the script
    to the vuejs package cdn(content delivery network) and 
    write our vuejs code which is possible because we imported 
    the script and it works. That is fine for simple apps.
    In more complex one you might probably have multple script
    imports. And you might have multiple packages you use.
    You want to put them together. You want build them. You
    might want to use ES6. We want to transform our code before
    uploaded to the server and we need some speciaf features 
    that development worflow can offer us. There are special 
    features that we can compile single file templates in vuejs
    application.

    4. Single File Templates 
    Single file templates are powerfull altnernative to 
    using the "el" property. This means that the template 
    is outsourced into a separate file. The workflow that we 
    will be using understands such single file templates and
    it will compile them. Template is transformed to js code
    and then executable in the browserLater we'll see how they work.

    5. Case-insensitive Component Selectors.
    This feature provide us more freedom in the way we call
    the components selectors.

    6. CSS Preprocessors 
    This workflow also provides compilation of CSS preprocesors
    such as SASS(SCSS)  

    7. No compiler in the browser. 
    This workflow is has no the build-in compiler in the browser and
    make makes VueJS package 30% smaller and faster. This means this 
    new worflow make the compilation 
    (transform everything into a javascript code) in before it ships 
    it in the browser.

    8. Vue CLI
    What is Vue CLI? Vue CLI is Standard Tooling for Vue.js Development.
    It fetches Vuejs project templates. 

    Vue CLI 3 official docs:
    https://cli.vuejs.org/

    !!! WORKSHOP HERE !!!
    9. Install Vue CLI 3:
    npm install -g @vue/cli  

    -g - means it install the package globally if you use mac or 
    linux add sudo in front of it 

    !!! IMPORTANT !!!
    If you are on Windows using Git Bash with minTTY, the interactive
    prompts will not work. 
    You must launch the command as: 

    winpty vue.cmd create hello-world 

    If you however want to still use the: 
    vue create hello-world syntax, 
    you can alias the command by adding the following line to your
    ~/.bashrc file and add the following comand.

    cd ~
    vim .bashrc
    alias vue='winpty vue.cmd' 
    
    to save and exit:
    ESC 
    :wq
    y
    
    You will need to restart your Git Bash terminal session to pull in
    the updated bashrc file.

    !!! WORKSHOP HERE !!!
    10. Create a Vue CLI 3 project using terminal
    10.1 Create project with following command:
    vue create $projectName

    run dev mode:
    npm run serve

    run prod mode:
    npm run build

    !!! WORKSHOP HERE !!!
    11. Create a Vue CLI 3 project using vue ui
    11.1 Create project with Vue Interface
    vue ui

    

    12. Checkout the folder structure of the installed project
    
    12.1 "src" folder is the most important. Here we write our vuejs code

    12.2 .babel.config.js - babel is transpiler allow us to write es6 and
    then it transpile it in es5

    12.3 public\index.html - the file that is actually get served. This
    the file will see in the end. This file is edited by vuejs 

    12.4 "dist" folder this is the folder containing all built assests 
    for production mode.
    You won't see in development mode because in development mode assets are
    in the memory of the pc.

    12.5 package.json - file manage all the dependencies. Vue-loader is important
    since it allows us to use these single file templates

    13. ".vue" file - single file template. This a special kind of file 
    which gets compiled during the build process so we can ship compiled
    code to the browser so we don't have to use the "el" property
    to have our html code converted to a template so we don't have to use the
    template property to create a string template. But then we a have
    a third option which allows us to outsource our template on our vuejs code
    in our vuejs code in separate files which will get compiled to normal js
    therefore are able to run natively in the browser. You can compile any
    template any html code to js in the end because they are js object 
    representations of your html elements. And that is how we want to build 
    our applications. First don't have to ship the compiler when deploying 
    our app. And second unlock new features which are not possible to be used 
    in the native DOM. 

    14. main.js file - that will be the first file which will executed 
    when the bundle is loaded to index.html file. 

    14.1 All is happening here we create a vue instance here.

    14.2 Import vue - that is how we have access to vuejs

    14.3 "}).$mount("#app");" - select the element that will replace the 
    vuejs template

    14.4 "render: h => h(App)" - we tell vuejs - instead of render div#app
    replace it with this template and add to the DOM. That is an ES6
    arrow function where h is the argument which to be a function then 
    executed and "render" is provided by vuejs. So vuejs executes the 
    render function and automatically passes another function the one we 
    captured here with "h" which then execute. And this function takes
    a vuejs template to be rendered. This function will automatically
    render a certain template in the place of this selector .$mount("#app")
    We load here our "h(App)" from App.vue file

    15. App.vue file - this our actual vue application. .vue files always 
    follows this structure>

    15.1 We've got <template> at the top, 
    
    15.2 Then we've got the script holding our vuejs code for this 
    template so like a new vue instance kind of.

    15.3 And then we've got some possible styling we want 

    15.4 We can remove the div#app without problem since we have it index.html
